# "Mapo" Tofu

### Ingredients
16 oz soft or silken tofu  
8 oz pork  
2-3 green onion stalks  
4 cloves of garlic  
3 tbsp soy sauce  
2 tbsp oyster sauce  
1 tbsp Shaoxing or rice wine  
1 tsp chili garlic sauce  
1 tsp sesame oil  
1/2 tsp salt  
1/2 tsp sugar  
1 tsp corn/potato starch (optional)
1 tsp dark soy sauce (optional)  
1 tsp MSG (optional)  

### Meat prep
Let meat marinate at least 2 hours or overnight if time allows.
1. Slice pork thinly into 1.5 inch pieces (across the grain if possible).
2. In a medium sized bowl, mix together:
   - pork
   - 2 tbsp soy sauce
   - 1 tbsp oyster sauce
   - 1 tbsp Shaoxing/rice wine
   - 1 tsp sesame oil
3. Keep in refrigerator while marinating.

### Instructions
1. Take out pork from fridge 10-15 minutes before cooking to allow meat to slightly warm up.
2. Peel garlic gloves and finely mince.
3. Wash green onions and cut off roots. Chop into 1/4 inch pieces.
4. Open and drain the tofu. Dice into 1/2 inch cubes.  
   If possible, use a cutting board with juice grooves, as tofu will release some liquid after cutting.
5. Pre-heat a medium skillet or wok on medium heat and coat the cooking surface with 1 tbsp cooking oil.
6. Fry the minced garlic until it begins to lightly brown.
7. Once garlic is brown, add pork to pan and sear.
8. Occasionally flip pork pieces and cook pork to 80% doneness or slightly pink. Pork will continue to cook while we add the rest of the ingredients.
9. Add tofu and any liquid remaining from the cutting board.
10. Reduce heat to low/medium-low.
11. Add sauces and seasonings to pan:
    - 1 tbsp soy sauce
    - 1 tbsp oyster sauce
    - 1 tsp chili garlic
    - 1/2 tsp salt
    - 1/2 tsp sugar
    - 1 tsp dark soy sauce (optional)
    - 1 tsp MSG (optional)
12. Add chopped green onions to pan.
13. Thicken the sauce (optional). In a small bowl, mix 1 tsp corn starch with 2 tsp room temp water until all lumps are gone. Add starch slurry into pan.
14. Gently stir and combine all the sauces. Stir with care as the soft tofu can break apart easily.
15. If you've added the starch slurry, the low heat and stirring should eventually cause the sauce to thicken.
16. Serve immediately.
